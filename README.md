# VIM

This is the configuration I currently use for day to day development.
When I stop using or add new technologies to my stack they will be updated here.

## Install
If you want to use this file to lead your development as well follow the commands below in your environment:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dedmonds784/.vim.git
ln -sf $HOME/.vim/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
cd $HOME/.vim
git submodule update --init
```

**Warning: Buyer beware! Do not use this configuration if you are not familiar with the contents of the plugins and values set in the vimrc. Similarly, do not copy-and-paste commands provided on this *README.md* without researching how they will effect your environment and if you need them!**
